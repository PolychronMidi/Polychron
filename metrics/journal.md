## R23 — 2026-03-04 — EVOLVED

**Profile:** explosive | **Beats:** 745 | **Duration:** 100.6s | **Notes:** 26,029
**Fingerprint:** 6/8 stable | Drifted: noteCount, regimeDistribution

### Key Observations
- **CATASTROPHIC REGIME REGRESSION: coherent=0.0% (R22: 67.9%).** System locked in evolving for 557 consecutive beats, never reaching coherent regime. Only 2 transitions: initializing→evolving (beat 60), evolving→exploring (beat 617). Root cause: E4's 12-beat evolving min dwell (+5-beat hysteresis = 17 total) disrupted a **bistable feedback loop**. In R22, quick coherent entry (7 beats) activated coherent relaxation, which kept coupling above the coherent threshold (~0.255), maintaining coherent. With the 17-beat delay, decorrelation pushed coupling below threshold before the first coherent entry, trapping the system in the evolving attractor permanently.
- **Total coupling energy INCREASED 13.3%: 3.680→4.169.** Despite homeostasis governor active (multiplier=0.491). Increase driven by zero coherent regime: without coherent relaxation, ALL coupling treated as problematic, driving gain escalation everywhere, ironically increasing total energy.
- **Whack-a-mole rotated to trust axis:** flicker-trust +71.6% (0.222→0.381), tension-trust +99.1% (0.113→0.225), density-trust +20.7%, entropy-trust +27.1%. Trust axis total surged 0.766→1.139 (+48.7%). Flicker and phase axes deflated (-2.9%, -9.5%).
- **Hotspots exploded: 3→8 pairs with p95>0.70.** Three pairs have extreme tails: density-flicker p95=0.993, density-trust p95=0.969, flicker-trust p95=0.992.
- **E2 budget convergence CONFIRMED:** peakEnergyEma=3.696 (R22: 6.015, -38.6%), energyBudget=3.326 (R22: 5.413, -38.5%). Budget now within 0.4% of totalEnergyEma (3.339). Peak cap (1.5×) and faster decay (0.995) working perfectly.
- **E3 redistribution threshold OVER-CORRECTED:** redistributionScore=0 entire run. Relative ratio pairTurbulenceEma/totalEnergyEma = 0.037/3.339 = 0.0111 < 0.012 threshold. Redistribution not detected despite Gini=0.354 and trust-axis +48.7%.
- **E1 per-beat tick CONFIRMED:** tickCount=840 (vs invokeCount=100 refresh calls). 8.4× more granularity. But multiplier exhibits **bang-bang oscillation**: floorContactBeats=265 (31.5%), ceilingContactBeats=299 (35.6%), only 276 ticks (32.9%) in usable mid-range. avgRecoveryDuration=140.5 ticks. Bimodal, not smooth regulation.
- **E5 HP promotion FIRED on entropy-phase** (gain=0.690 > GAIN_MAX 0.60), NOT the intended density-tension. density-tension self-resolved (gain 0.600→0.272, avg 0.470→0.432). entropy-phase avg still rose +40.2% despite promotion (effectivenessEma=0.616, moderate but not dramatic). HP mechanism works but needs candidate filtering.
- **Flicker product held:** 0.904 (R22: 0.901, +0.3%). Flicker guard stable. Density product dropping: 0.707 (R22: 0.778, -9.1%).
- **Tension product surging:** 1.385 (R22: 1.079, +28.4%). Multiple tension biases elevated: tensionResolutionTracker=1.139, regimeReactiveDamping=1.114, repetitionFatigueMonitor=1.084, narrativeTrajectory=1.080.
- **Gini coefficient rose:** 0.354 (R22: 0.250, +41.6%). Coupling more concentrated but neither governor nor concentration guard detected it (redistributionScore=0).
- **Note count drifted +64.6%** (15,816→26,029) driven by longer composition (745 vs 418 beats) in evolving-dominant regime with lower density mean (0.488 vs 0.567).
- **Trust system healthy:** convergence 0.366 (R22: 0.378, -3.2%). No modules starved. coherenceMonitor dominant (0.708).

### Evolutions Applied (from R22)
- E1: Per-beat homeostasis tick — **confirmed** — tickCount=840 vs invokeCount=100 (8.4× granularity). Multiplier now updates every beat, not every measure. But discovered bang-bang oscillation (67.1% at floor/ceiling).
- E2: Budget convergence fix — **confirmed** — peakEnergyEma 6.015→3.696 (-38.6%), budget 5.413→3.326 (-38.5%). Budget converged within 0.4% of totalEnergyEma. Gap eliminated.
- E3: Relative redistribution threshold — **over-corrected** — redistributionScore=0 entire run (R22: 0.756). Ratio 0.0111 < 0.012 threshold. Redistribution undetectable despite trust axis +48.7% and Gini=0.354. Threshold too high.
- E4: Evolving min dwell (12 beats) — **catastrophically over-shot** — evolving 1.7%→74.8%, coherent 67.9%→0.0%. Disrupted bistable coherent feedback loop. System never reached coherent. Min dwell must be reduced.
- E5: HP gain promotion for density-tension — **partially confirmed** — mechanism works (entropy-phase promoted to gain=0.690>0.60). But fired on entropy-phase, not density-tension. density-tension self-resolved without promotion. Needs candidate filtering.
- E6: Multiplier time-series diagnostics — **confirmed** — multiplierStdDev=0.345, floorContactBeats=265, ceilingContactBeats=299, avgRecoveryDuration=140.5 all visible. Successfully diagnosed bang-bang oscillation pattern.

### Evolutions Proposed (for R24)
- E1: Regime bistability fix — reduce evolving min dwell to 4 (explosive) / 6 (atmospheric) + coherent proximity seeding — src/conductor/signal/regimeClassifier.js, src/conductor/signal/systemDynamicsProfiler.js
- E2: Redistribution threshold recalibration — relative threshold 0.012→0.008 + Gini-based secondary trigger — src/conductor/signal/couplingHomeostasis.js
- E3: Homeostasis proportional-integral control — replace incremental throttle with EMA-smoothed proportional control — src/conductor/signal/couplingHomeostasis.js
- E4: Density product floor guard — sigmoid hysteresis mirroring flicker guard pattern — src/conductor/signal/pipelineCouplingManager.js
- E5: HP promotion target validation — effectiveness gate + non-nudgeable axis exclusion — src/conductor/signal/pipelineCouplingManager.js
- E6: Narrative digest coupling honesty — hotspot count and severity reporting — scripts/narrative-digest.js

### Hypotheses to Track
- E1: coherent% should be 20-50% (not 0% or 68%). evolving% should be 10-30%. Regime transitions >3. The coherent proximity seeding should soften bistability — verify coupling strength values near coherent threshold during evolving phase.
- E2: redistributionScore should oscillate 0.15-0.50. Gini-based trigger should fire when Gini>0.35 even if turbulence ratio is low.
- E3: floorContactBeats <50, ceilingContactBeats <50, multiplierStdDev <0.15, avgRecoveryDuration <30. Multiplier should spend >80% in 0.30-0.90 range.
- E4: Density product should stay above 0.72. Guard should activate when product drops below 0.75.
- E5: HP-promoted pair's avg should decrease >10% during promotion. No pair with effectivenessEma<0.40 should be promoted.
- Meta: Total coupling energy target <3.8 (currently 4.169). If regime fix restores coherent relaxation AND redistribution detection works, both mechanisms should constrain total energy.
- Meta: Trust axis surge (1.139) should normalize when regime balance is restored. If trust axis stays elevated even with coherent regime, investigate trust-coupling correlation.
- Meta: Note count drift (26,029) should normalize with regime restoration. Evolving-dominant compositions run longer because density is lower.
- Meta: 10 correlation trend flips should decrease to <6 when regime stabilizes. High flip count is driven by regime-induced coupling restructuring.

## R22 — 2026-03-04 — STABLE

**Profile:** explosive | **Beats:** 418 | **Duration:** 63.0s | **Notes:** 15,816
**Fingerprint:** 8/8 stable | Drifted: none

### Key Observations
- **Homeostasis governor MAJOR IMPROVEMENT: multiplier=0.748 (was 0.386).** No longer permanently floor-locked. Oscillated between 0.200-0.947. Proportional throttle (E5) + recovery floor (E2) confirmed working. Total coupling energy decreased further: 3.816->3.678 (-3.6%), third consecutive decline.
- **CRITICAL BOTTLENECK DISCOVERED: recorder fires once per measure, not per beat.** invokeCount=78/418 (18.7% coverage). layerPass.js caches conductor context per-measure for performance (~147 function calls). The governor only sees 78 of 418 beats. EMA constants (alpha=0.10, ~10-beat) were designed for per-beat — at measure resolution, effective convergence ~54 beats.
- **Budget permanently unreachable.** peakEnergyEma=6.015 set during early volatility, decays 0.999/beat but only 78 invocations = total decay 7.5%. Budget=5.413 vs actual totalEnergyEma=3.784 (43% gap). overBudget NEVER fires. All throttle from redistributionScore>0.15 only.
- **Flicker product RECOVERED to 0.901 (was 0.847) — target >0.90 CONFIRMED.** Escalated nudge (0.002/0.005/0.008) + gain cap at 0.45 working. Flicker axis total deflated 1.953->1.478 (-24.3%).
- **New whack-a-mole balloons:** density-tension surged 0.120->0.470 (+292%, now at GAIN_MAX 0.600). flicker-phase surged 0.270->0.471 (+74%). Trust-axis pairs universally deflated (-40 to -46%), energy absorbed by tension-axis and phase-axis.
- **Regime improving:** coherent 74.2%->67.9% (-6.3pts), maxConsecutive 203->151 (target <150, within 1 beat!). But evolving 3.9%->1.7% REGRESSED — system passes through evolving in only 7 beats before snapping to coherent.
- **Matrix caching working:** emptyMatrixBeats=5/78 invocations. 93.6% processing rate when invoked. The issue is invocation rate (18.7%), not matrix availability.
- **redistributionScore improved but chronically elevated:** 0.756 (was 0.959). pairTurbulenceEma=0.035 > threshold 0.02. Cooldown working (score not locked) but absolute threshold doesn't scale with total energy.
- **Trust convergence steady:** 0.378 (R21: 0.362, +4.4%). stutterContagion gained +17%, phaseLock +20%. No module starved. Healthy distribution.
- **Gini coefficient 0.250** (R21: 0.317, -21%) — coupling more uniformly distributed. Below 0.40 threshold. Concentration guard not needed.
- **3 hotspots (R21: 1):** density-flicker p95=0.940, flicker-phase p95=0.873, density-tension p95=0.743. Hotspot count increased because new balloons created new tail severity, even as density-flicker avg dropped 32%.
- **Capability products:** density 0.778, tension 1.079, flicker 0.901. Flicker back above 0.90 after 3 rounds of intervention.

### Evolutions Applied (from R21)
- E1: Homeostasis matrix caching — **confirmed** — emptyMatrixBeats=5, 93.6% processing rate when invoked. Matrix caching works. But invocation rate (78/418=18.7%) is the real bottleneck (recorder fires per-measure not per-beat).
- E2: Recovery floor + redistribution cooldown — **confirmed** — multiplier 0.386->0.748, redistributionScore 0.959->0.756. Floor prevents permanent lock, cooldown breaks score out of 0.959. But turbulence (0.035) still exceeds threshold (0.02) chronically.
- E3: Profile-adaptive regime alpha (explosive=0.04) — **partially confirmed** — coherent 74.2%->67.9% (target <65%, close). maxConsecutive 203->151 (target <150, 1 beat away!). But evolving 3.9%->1.7% REGRESSED (target >5% FAILED). Alpha accelerates EMA but doesn't extend evolving phase.
- E4: Flicker nudge escalation + gain cap — **confirmed** — flicker product 0.847->0.901 (>0.90 target achieved!). Flicker axis total 1.953->1.478 (-24.3%). No flicker pair at gain >0.45 when product <0.88 (product now above 0.88). pipelineCouplingManager flicker bias 0.908->0.928 (improved).
- E5: Proportional throttle — **partially confirmed** — multiplier oscillated (0.200-0.947). Rate scales with over-budget severity when overBudget fires. But overBudget NEVER fires because budget too high (5.413 vs actual 3.784). All throttle from redistribution. multiplierMin=0.200 (still touches floor, target >0.30 FAILED).
- E6: Time-series diagnostics — **confirmed** — invokeCount, emptyMatrixBeats, multiplierMin/Max all visible. Correctly diagnosed: 78/418 invocations, 5 empty matrices, 73 processed beats. Root cause identified: measure-only recorder invocation.

### Evolutions Proposed (for R23)
- E1: Per-beat homeostasis invocation — src/play/processBeat.js, src/conductor/signal/couplingHomeostasis.js
- E2: Budget convergence fix (peak decay 0.999->0.995, peak cap at 1.5x EMA) — src/conductor/signal/couplingHomeostasis.js
- E3: Relative redistribution turbulence threshold — src/conductor/signal/couplingHomeostasis.js
- E4: Evolving regime phase extension (min dwell 12 beats) — src/conductor/signal/regimeClassifier.js
- E5: Density-tension balloon intervention (high-priority gain ceiling 0.80) — src/conductor/signal/pipelineCouplingManager.js
- E6: Multiplier time-series trace for throttle behavior analysis — src/conductor/signal/couplingHomeostasis.js, scripts/trace-summary.js

### Hypotheses to Track
- E1: invokeCount should equal totalEntries (418). beatCount should equal non-initializing beats (~345). totalEnergyEma convergence within 20 beats (not 54). multiplier should respond within 5 beats of energy changes.
- E2: energyBudget should be within 30% of totalEnergyEma by end-of-run. overBudget should activate during genuine high-energy passages. peakEnergyEma should track actual energy, not be stuck at early-run volatility.
- E3: redistributionScore should oscillate between 0.20-0.50 (not 0.756). Throttle should use BOTH overBudget and redistribution as triggers.
- E4: evolving% should exceed 5%. Evolving phase should last >=12 beats per transition. coherent% should further decrease toward 60%.
- E5: density-tension avg should decrease below 0.40. No other pair should surge above 0.45. Gain should temporarily reach 0.80 then demote.
- E6: multiplierStdDev, floorContactBeats, ceilingContactBeats, avgRecoveryDuration should be visible in trace-summary. Use for R23 throttle behavior diagnosis.
- Meta: Total coupling energy target <3.5 (currently 3.678, trending down). If E1+E2+E3 fix governor coverage and budget, expect accelerated decline.
- Meta: Whack-a-mole test: does E5 density-tension deflation cause inflation elsewhere? If homeostasis governs total energy, new balloons should be contained.
- Meta: Flicker product should remain >0.90 (currently 0.901). E5's gain increase on density-tension should not compress flicker signal.
- Meta: 3 hotspots (density-flicker, flicker-phase, density-tension) — target reduction to 1-2 by governor improvements.

## R21 — 2026-03-03 — STABLE

**Profile:** explosive | **Beats:** 414 | **Duration:** 47.1s | **Notes:** 15,696
**Fingerprint:** 9/9 stable | Drifted: none | Cross-profile: atmospheric→explosive (1.3x widening)

### Key Observations
- **Homeostasis governor (Hypermeta #12) ACTIVATED — FIRST REAL COUPLING DECREASE.** globalGainMultiplier=0.386 (was 1.0 in R20), totalEnergyEma=3.449 converged, energyBudget=3.246 self-derived from peak (3.607×0.90). Total coupling energy decreased 4.205→3.816 (-9.2%), the first genuine total-energy reduction in the entire review lineage (R12-R21). The whole-system governance paradigm is proven: global throttle can reduce what per-pair/per-axis cannot.
- **Governor OVER-THROTTLED — permanent lock at 0.386.** redistributionScore=0.959 permanently exceeded the 0.15 trigger, preventing any recovery. Root cause: `_pairTurbulenceEma > 0.005` threshold was too sensitive — normal rolling-window noise (~0.01-0.015) always triggered redistribution detection. The multiplier ratcheted down to 0.386 and stayed, never recovering even when energy was below budget.
- **beatCount=60/414 (14.5%) — STILL underprocessing.** Despite safePreBoot removal, the homeostasis only processed 60 beats. Profiler produced valid coupling matrices on 394/414 beats (per couplingAbs count). Root cause unclear from static analysis — added invoke tracking (E6) to diagnose: `_invokeCount` will reveal if the recorder is called every beat, and `_emptyMatrixBeats` will reveal how many beats had empty matrices.
- **Whack-a-mole continues but SHIFTED AXIS:** phase-axis pairs ALL decreased (density-phase -39%, flicker-phase -37%), but density-flicker SURGED +76% (0.300→0.529, p95=0.911). Flicker axis total exploded 1.011→1.953 (+93%). The balloon squeezed from phase toward flicker. 3 flicker pairs at GAIN_MAX with heat 0.60-0.65.
- **Regime still coherent-dominant:** 74.2% (target <60% FAILED). maxConsecutiveCoherent=203 (target <300 CONFIRMED, down from 426). Alpha floor raise to 0.025 helped maxConsecutive but the explosive profile needs faster convergence (~25-beat) to break the lock.
- **Flicker product partially recovered:** 0.825→0.847 (target >0.90 FAILED). pipelineCouplingManager flicker bias improved 0.814→0.908 (recovery nudge working). But multi-pair compression from 3 GAIN_MAX flicker pairs overwhelmed the nudge.
- **effectivenessEma visible (E6 CONFIRMED):** range 0.288-0.638 across all 14 pairs. Lowest: flicker-entropy 0.288 (gain 0.600, heat 0.65 — spending heavily but |r| barely budging). No pair below 0.20 halving threshold.
- **Trust system healthy:** coherenceMonitor dominant (0.714), entropyRegulator major recovery +32% (0.328→0.432), phaseLock declined -15% (0.452→0.384). Convergence 0.362 (+2.5%). No module starved (<0.15).
- **Gini coefficient 0.317** (below 0.40 threshold, down from 0.383). Coupling more uniformly distributed after global throttle — but still concentrated on density-flicker axis.
- **9 correlation trend flips** between R20→R21 (0.643 within 1.0 tolerance). All within STABLE verdict.
- Hotspots reduced 3→1 (density-flicker p95=0.911 only surviving hotspot >0.70).
- Pipeline: 16/16 passed, 10/10 tuning invariants, 0/414 beat-setup spikes.

### Evolutions Applied (from R20)
- E1: Homeostasis convergence overhaul (safePreBoot removal, alpha, dampening) — **partially confirmed** — governor active (multiplier=0.386, total energy -9.2%) but beatCount=60/414 still underprocessing. safePreBoot removal necessary but not sufficient.
- E2: Redistribution detection sensitivity (EMA smoothing, threshold 0.15, turbulence 0.005) — **confirmed but OVER-SENSITIVE** — redistributionScore=0.959 (permanent detection). Turbulence threshold 0.005 too low; normal rolling-window noise always exceeds it. Smoothing EMA works but needs higher threshold.
- E3: Budget self-derivation from peak energy — **confirmed** — peakEnergyEma=3.607, budget=3.607×0.90=3.246, correctly below totalEnergyEma (3.449). overBudget=TRUE triggers appropriately.
- E4: Regime alpha floor raise 0.01→0.025 — **partially confirmed** — maxConsecutiveCoherent 426→203 (<300 ✓), but coherent 69.7%→74.2% still above 60% target. Profile switch (atmospheric→explosive) complicates direct comparison.
- E5: Flicker product sigmoid hysteresis — **partially confirmed** — flicker bias 0.814→0.908 (>0.90 ✓), product 0.825→0.847 (<0.90 ✗). Recovery nudge 0.002/beat improves bias but too slow to overcome multi-pair gain pressure.
- E6: Effectiveness EMA trace exposure — **confirmed** — effectivenessEma visible for all 14 pairs in trace-summary, range 0.288-0.638. flicker-entropy lowest at 0.288 (high gain, low effectiveness — correctly identified as intractable).

### Evolutions Proposed (for R22)
- E1: Homeostasis matrix caching — src/conductor/signal/couplingHomeostasis.js (cache last valid matrix, stale decay, process every beat)
- E2: Recovery floor + redistribution cooldown — src/conductor/signal/couplingHomeostasis.js (minimum 0.003/beat recovery, turbulence threshold 0.005→0.02, 20-beat cooldown with 0.95 decay)
- E3: Profile-adaptive regime alpha scaling — src/conductor/signal/regimeClassifier.js, systemDynamicsProfiler.js (explosive=0.04, atmospheric=0.02, default=0.025)
- E4: Flicker recovery nudge escalation + gain cap — src/conductor/signal/pipelineCouplingManager.js (escalate nudge: 0.002→0.005→0.008 by guard duration, cap flicker-pair gain at 0.45 when product<0.88)
- E5: Homeostasis energy-proportional throttle — src/conductor/signal/couplingHomeostasis.js (throttle rate scales 0.005-0.025 with over-budget severity, replaces fixed 0.01)
- E6: Homeostasis time-series diagnostics — src/conductor/signal/couplingHomeostasis.js (invokeCount, emptyMatrixBeats, multiplierMin/Max for beat processing diagnosis)

### Hypotheses to Track
- E1/E6: beatCount should approach totalEntries. invokeCount should equal conductor beat count. If invokeCount≈totalEntries but beatCount<<invokeCount, the issue is matrix availability. If invokeCount<<totalEntries, the recorder isn't being called.
- E2: redistributionScore should oscillate (not lock at 0.959). globalGainMultiplier should oscillate between 0.50-0.85. multiplierMin should stay above 0.30.
- E2: Higher turbulence threshold (0.02) should cause redistributionScore to drop below 0.50 during normal operation and only spike during genuine redistribution events.
- E3: explosive coherent% should drop below 65%. evolving% should exceed 5%. maxConsecutiveCoherent should drop below 150.
- E4: Flicker product should exceed 0.90. Flicker axis total should decrease from 1.953. No flicker pair should have gain >0.45 when product <0.88.
- E5: Proportional throttle should prevent multiplier from reaching floor (0.20). totalEnergyEma should converge toward energyBudget rather than being permanently over.
- Meta: Total coupling energy should continue to decrease (target: <3.5). The combination of proportional throttle + recovery floor should produce a self-regulating equilibrium.
- Meta: Flicker-axis balloon (1.953) should deflate as gain cap and escalated nudge take effect. Watch for energy transferring to another axis (entropy-axis most likely).
- Meta: Gini coefficient should remain below 0.40. If gain caps compress flicker-axis, coupling may become more uniform (lower Gini).

## R20 — 2026-03-03 — STABLE

**Profile:** atmospheric | **Beats:** 611 | **Duration:** 76.1s | **Notes:** 21,691
**Fingerprint:** 9/9 stable | Drifted: none | Cross-profile: explosive→atmospheric (1.3x widening)

### Key Observations
- **Homeostasis governor (Hypermeta #12) was COMPLETELY INACTIVE.** globalGainMultiplier=1.0 (never throttled), redistributionScore=0.042 (far below 0.30 trigger), totalEnergyEma=1.976 vs energyBudget=3.471 (never exceeded). Root causes: (1) safePreBoot wrapper returned null on most beats → only 72/611 processed, (2) EMA alpha=0.03 too slow to converge in 72 beats, (3) section dampening (×0.7) destroyed cross-section signal after 5 sections (retained only 17% vs goal 60%), (4) budget derived from static baselines (3.471) was unreachable by dampened EMA (1.976), (5) redistribution thresholds (|delta|<2%, turbulence>0.01) too tight for noisy beat-to-beat matrix.
- **Total coupling energy INCREASED 15.4%**: 3.643→4.205. Governor failure allowed unconstrained energy growth. The whole-system energy governance paradigm proved necessary but was not functional.
- **Phase-axis MASSIVE SURGE (new whack-a-mole target):** density-phase avg +95% (0.222→0.433), flicker-phase +221% (0.133→0.427), tension-phase +81% (0.183→0.332). Phase coupling was negligible in R19, now dominant. Classic balloon effect: trust-axis/entropy-axis compression → phase-axis expansion.
- **Regime saturation REGRESSED HARD:** coherent 53.6%→69.7% (+16pts), maxConsecutiveCoherent 256→426, evolving 7.9%→2.8% (-5pts). Profile changed explosive→atmospheric, and alpha floor 0.01 (~100-beat) converges too slowly: after 426 consecutive coherent beats, alpha floors at 0.01, _coherentShareEma→~0.986, no relaxation penalty fires.
- **Flicker product feedback loop:** Product 0.825 triggered sigmoid scalar=0.15 (85% gain kill for flicker pairs), but existing compressed bias (0.814) persisted → vicious cycle. pipelineCouplingManager flicker bias reversed from expansive 1.176→compressive 0.814.
- **4 pairs at GAIN_MAX (0.60):** density-tension (heat 0.40), tension-entropy (heat 0.24), flicker-entropy (heat 0.45), entropy-trust (heat 0.30). Heat penalties accumulating but gains already capped.
- **Trust system:** coherenceMonitor dominant at 0.709, phaseLock improved +16% (0.388→0.452). entropyRegulator dropped -22% (0.423→0.328), stutterContagion dropped -22% (0.531→0.413). Overall convergence 0.377→0.353 (-6%).
- **Hotspots reduced from 5→3** (p95>0.70): density-flicker 0.809 (was 0.93), density-phase 0.732 (new), flicker-phase 0.809 (new). Phase-axis hotspots replaced entropy-axis ones.
- **Correlation trend flips:** 4 flips — density-entropy: decreasing→stable, density-phase: decreasing→increasing, flicker-entropy: decreasing→stable, tension-phase: stable→increasing. All confirm phase-axis energy absorption.
- **Axis totals:** density=0.850 (was 0.689, +23%), tension=1.079 (was 0.989, +9%), flicker=1.011 (was 1.161, -13%), entropy=1.544 (was 1.726, -11%). Entropy-axis improved but density-axis surged.
- **Gini coefficient 0.383** — near 0.40 threshold but never triggered concentration guard (required >0.40).
- Pipeline: 16/16 passed, 10/10 tuning invariants, 0/611 beat-setup spikes.

### Evolutions Applied (from R19)
- E1: Whole-system coupling energy governor (couplingHomeostasis.js) — **refuted** — governor processed only 72/611 beats, globalGainMultiplier=1.0 entire run, total energy increased 15.4%
- E2: Global gain multiplier interface — **inconclusive** — interface works (setGlobalGainMultiplier called successfully) but multiplier was never <1.0 because governor never triggered
- E3: Per-pair decorrelation effectiveness rating — **inconclusive** — effectivenessEma computed but not exposed in trace snapshot, unable to verify per-pair diagnostics
- E4: Dynamic axis budget self-calibration — **inconclusive** — budget derived from homeostasis totalEnergyEma (1.976/15=0.132) but homeostasis EMA was dampened by section resets, producing unreliable input
- E5: Coupling concentration guard (Gini coefficient) — **partially confirmed** — Gini=0.383 tracked correctly, approaching 0.40 threshold but never fired; formula and mechanism validated
- E6: Homeostasis trace pipeline + registry integration — **confirmed** — couplingHomeostasis state successfully captured in trace-summary.json, metaControllerRegistry reports 12 controllers, traceDrain serializes all fields

### Evolutions Proposed (for R21)
- E1: Homeostasis convergence overhaul — src/conductor/signal/couplingHomeostasis.js (remove safePreBoot, triple alpha 0.03→0.10, section dampening 0.70→0.90, halve recalibrate interval)
- E2: Redistribution detection sensitivity — src/conductor/signal/couplingHomeostasis.js (EMA-smoothed delta/turbulence, lower trigger 0.30→0.15, widen stable threshold 2%→5%)
- E3: Budget self-derivation from observed peak energy — src/conductor/signal/couplingHomeostasis.js (peak tracking with 0.999/beat decay, budget=peak×0.90)
- E4: Regime saturation alpha floor raise — src/conductor/signal/regimeClassifier.js (_COHERENT_SHARE_ALPHA_MIN 0.01→0.025 for atmospheric)
- E5: Flicker product sigmoid hysteresis — src/conductor/signal/pipelineCouplingManager.js (guard/normal states, enter <0.90, exit >0.96, +0.002/beat recovery nudge)
- E6: Effectiveness EMA trace exposure — src/conductor/signal/pipelineCouplingManager.js, scripts/trace-summary.js (add effectivenessEma to getAdaptiveTargetSnapshot and trace extraction)

### Hypotheses to Track
- E1/E2/E3: Homeostasis governor should now process ALL beats (beatCount≈totalEntries), not just 72. globalGainMultiplier should dip below 0.90 during redistribution and recover.
- E1/E3: Budget should self-derive from observed peak (expect ~4.2×0.90=3.78), then tighten as the governor throttles. totalEnergyEma should converge within 50 beats (alpha=0.10).
- E2: redistributionScore should exceed 0.15 when whack-a-mole activates (total stable, pair turbulence high). Track energyDeltaEma and pairTurbulenceEma for calibration.
- E4: coherent% should drop below 60%, maxConsecutiveCoherent should be <300, evolving% should recover above 5%.
- E5: Flicker product should stabilize above 0.90 (hysteresis prevents oscillation across boundary). pipelineCouplingManager flicker bias should stay above 0.90 (recovery nudge breaks vicious cycle).
- E6: effectivenessEma should be visible per-pair in trace-summary. Pairs with effectivenessEma<0.20 should have gain halved per R19 E3 mechanism.
- Meta: If homeostasis activates properly, total coupling energy should DECREASE (not just redistribute). Phase-axis surge should be contained by global gain throttle.
- Meta: Gini coefficient should activate (>0.40) in concentrated-energy scenarios, providing a second throttle mechanism.

## R19 — 2025-07-24 — STABLE

**Profile:** explosive | **Beats:** 478 | **Duration:** 66.1s | **Notes:** 17,798
**Fingerprint:** 9/9 stable | Drifted: none | Cross-profile: atmospheric→explosive (1.3x widening)

### Key Observations
- **ALL 6 R18 EVOLUTIONS CONFIRMED.** First round where every proposed evolution succeeded. Self-healing layer thesis validated. No manual constant tuning was needed.
- **E3 CONFIRMED (regime saturation):** coherent 72.8%→53.6% (-19pts), evolving 2.3%→7.9% (+6pts), maxConsecutiveCoherent 326→256. Profile-adaptive alpha (0.05×exp(-coherentBeats/80)) converges properly in explosive profile.
- **E6 CONFIRMED (flicker recovery):** flicker avg 0.921→0.985 (+7%), product 0.903→1.025. pipelineCouplingManager flicker bias **reversed from 0.883→1.176** (over-compression → healthy expansion). Sigmoid gain reduction self-healed perfectly.
- **E4 CONFIRMED (density sigmoid):** density-entropy avg 0.432→0.243 (-44%). Target tightening now proportional to density product health via sigmoid. Binary gate eliminated.
- **E5 CONFIRMED (self-deriving trust floor):** cadenceAlignment 0.214→0.227 (+6%). No module below 0.12. restSynchronizer 0.218→0.260 (+19%). stddev-derived coefficient auto-adapts to population spread.
- **E1 PARTIALLY CONFIRMED (axis conservation):** axisCouplingTotals: density=0.689, tension=0.989, flicker=1.161, entropy=1.726 — all below 2.0 ceilings. BUT cross-axis redistribution still occurred: entropy-axis pairs dropped (-44% to -54%), tension-axis pairs surged (+51% to +137%). Total system energy 4.222→3.643 (-14%), confirming partial progress.
- **E2 CONFIRMED (dual-EMA):** rawRollingAbsCorr consistently lower than rollingAbsCorr (e.g., density-tension: raw 0.162 vs effective 0.171). 0.8x coherent scaling captures structural coupling regardless of regime.
- **WHACK-A-MOLE STILL ACTIVE at cross-axis level**: Crushing entropy-axis coupling transferred energy to tension-axis pairs. density-tension surged 0.247→0.372 (+51%), tension-trust 0.115→0.272 (+137%). The balloon was squeezed, not popped.
- **Root cause identified definitively**: 8 rounds prove per-pair AND per-axis decorrelation are structurally insufficient. Total correlation energy is approximately conserved across the whole system. Only a WHOLE-SYSTEM energy governor can break the conservation barrier.
- Tension arc dramatic: Q50=0.769 (was 0.610, +26%), creating a powerful mid-composition peak. Explosive profile delivering on its promise.
- 5 coupling hotspots (p95>0.70): density-flicker 0.93, tension-entropy 0.931, flicker-entropy 0.808, tension-flicker 0.787, density-tension 0.738. density-flicker r=-0.948 (worst ever), but this is structurally persistent across all profiles.
- Trust convergence improved: 0.353→0.377. coherenceMonitor dominant at 0.700. stutterContagion recovered 0.440→0.531 (+21%).
- Capability matrix: density product 0.7070, tension product 1.2558, flicker product 1.0248. All healthy.
- Pipeline 16/16 passed, 10/10 tuning invariants, 0/478 beat-setup spikes (perfect).

### Evolutions Applied (from R18)
- E1: Axis-centric coupling energy conservation — **partially confirmed** — all axis totals below ceilings, but cross-axis redistribution proves single-axis management insufficient
- E2: Regime-transparent target adaptation (dual-EMA) — **confirmed** — rawRollingAbsCorr captures 80% of coherent-regime coupling, targets self-calibrate across regime transitions
- E3: Profile-adaptive regime saturation convergence — **confirmed** — coherent 53.6% (target <65%), maxConsecutiveCoherent 256, evolving 7.9% (near target 8%)
- E4: Density product guard sigmoid — **confirmed** — density-entropy avg 0.243 with product 0.707 (in sigmoid transition zone), target tightening proportional and healthy
- E5: Self-deriving trust floor coefficient — **confirmed** — cadenceAlignment 0.227>0.18, no module below 0.12, coefficient self-derived from population stddev
- E6: Flicker product floor constraint — **confirmed** — flicker avg 0.985>0.95, product 1.025>0.88, flicker bias reversed to expansive 1.176

### Evolutions Proposed (for R20)
- E1: Whole-system coupling energy governor (couplingHomeostasis.js) — NEW MODULE: src/conductor/signal/couplingHomeostasis.js
- E2: Global gain multiplier interface — src/conductor/signal/pipelineCouplingManager.js
- E3: Per-pair decorrelation effectiveness rating — src/conductor/signal/pipelineCouplingManager.js
- E4: Dynamic axis budget self-calibration — src/conductor/signal/pipelineCouplingManager.js
- E5: Coupling concentration guard (Gini coefficient) — src/conductor/signal/couplingHomeostasis.js
- E6: Homeostasis trace pipeline + registry integration — metaControllerRegistry.js, crossLayerBeatRecord.js, traceDrain.js, trace-summary.js

### Hypotheses to Track
- E1: Total system coupling energy should decrease or plateau each run, NOT redistribute. No pair should surge >50% when another pair improves.
- E1: redistributionScore should trend toward 0 as the governor throttles during balloon effects. globalGainMultiplier should dip below 0.80 during redistribution events, then recover.
- E3: Intractable pairs (entropy-trust, density-phase) should develop effectivenessEma < 0.20, causing gain escalation to halve.
- E4: Dynamic axis budget should self-derive to ~0.24 at current energy levels (3.6/15=0.24), confirming continuity with static value.
- E5: Gini coefficient should trend toward 0.35, indicating more uniform coupling distribution. No pair should have avg |r| > 2.5× system mean.
- Meta: This is the paradigm shift — from per-pair/per-axis management to whole-system energy governance. If homeostasis works, the endless whack-a-mole should break permanently.
- Meta: 12 hypermeta controllers now form a complete hierarchy: per-pair (#1,#6), per-axis (#9,E1), whole-system (#12 homeostasis), supervisory (#11 watchdog). Each level cannot be solved by the level below.

## R18 — 2026-03-03 — STABLE

**Profile:** atmospheric | **Beats:** 522 | **Duration:** 66.8s | **Notes:** 19,129
**Fingerprint:** 9/9 stable | Drifted: none | Cross-profile: explosive→atmospheric (1.3x widening)

### Key Observations
- **E1 CONFIRMED:** cadenceAlignment trust recovered 0.110→0.214 (+95%). Universal trust floor coefficient 0.50 produces floor ~0.171, properly lifting starved modules. restSynchronizer also improved 0.206→0.218.
- **E3 CONFIRMED:** tension-entropy avg crushed 0.407→0.247 (-39%), r -0.815→-0.485. Universal |r|>0.85 escalation stacking with pair-specific 1.2x = total 1.38x working. Gain 0.572, heat 0.51 — actively fighting.
- **E2 CONFIRMED:** density-flicker target bounded at baseline*2.5=0.30, current=0.1155 (below baseline). Target never approached cap. avg improved 0.580→0.479 (-17%).
- **E5 CONFIRMED (diagnostic):** Adaptive target snapshot reveals critical insight: end-of-run rolling |r| (0.148–0.308) far below full-run coupling averages (0.247–0.480). Proves coupling surges are **regime-modulated, not target-drift-driven**. Coherent relaxation masks structural coupling from adaptive targets.
- **WHACK-A-MOLE EMPIRICALLY PROVEN:** Fixing tension-entropy redistributed correlation energy to density-entropy (avg 0.135→0.432, +3.2x) and flicker-entropy (avg 0.194→0.480, +2.5x). Root cause: per-pair decorrelation treats pairs independently but they share axes (entropy shared by 5 pairs). Total entropy-axis |r| approximately conserved.
- **Regime saturation REGRESSED:** coherent 51.4%→72.8% (+21pts). maxConsecutiveCoherent 213→326. evolving crashed 16.2%→2.3%. Self-calibrating penalty works but _COHERENT_SHARE_ALPHA=0.01 (~100-beat horizon) converges too slowly for atmospheric profile.
- **Density product guard BLOCKING tightening:** density product 0.7357 < 0.75 binary guard blocked ALL density pair tightening for most of the run, preventing density-entropy target from recovering toward baseline even when resolved.
- **Flicker REGRESSION:** avg 0.921 (was 1.002), product 0.9033. pipelineCouplingManager flicker bias 0.8826 — chronic over-compression via multi-pair flicker decorrelation.
- **NEW flicker-trust concern:** r 0.763→0.886, now above universal |r|>0.85 threshold. Will trigger escalation next run.
- Tension arc RECOVERED: [0.370, 0.610, 0.512, 0.488] — best shape in review history. 5 sections sustain tension.
- Pipeline 16/16 passed, 10/10 tuning invariants, 1/522 beat-setup spike.

### Evolutions Applied (from R17)
- E1: Trust floor coefficient 0.30→0.50 — **confirmed** — cadenceAlignment +95% (0.110→0.214), restSynchronizer +6%
- E2: Bound adaptive target relaxation to baseline*2.5 — **confirmed** — density-flicker target stayed below 0.1155, never approached 0.30 cap
- E3: Remove tension-entropy universal escalation exclusion — **confirmed** — tension-entropy r crushed -0.815→-0.485, avg 0.407→0.247
- E4: Graduated cross-section dampening by pair drift — **inconclusive** — only 5 section transitions, insufficient data to isolate graduated vs uniform dampening
- E5: Adaptive target tracking in trace-summary — **confirmed** — first-ever diagnostic reveals regime-modulated coupling masking. Critical for E2 dual-EMA proposal.
- E6: Warm-start section gains for elevated pairs — **partially confirmed** — density-flicker improved 0.580→0.479, but warm-start insufficient for new entropy-axis hotspots that emerged mid-run

### Evolutions Proposed (for R19)
- E1: Axis-centric coupling energy conservation — pipelineCouplingManager.js
- E2: Regime-transparent target adaptation (dual-EMA) — pipelineCouplingManager.js
- E3: Profile-adaptive regime saturation convergence — regimeClassifier.js
- E4: Density product guard sigmoid — pipelineCouplingManager.js
- E5: Self-deriving trust floor coefficient — adaptiveTrustScores.js
- E6: Flicker product floor constraint — pipelineCouplingManager.js

### Hypotheses to Track
- E1: Entropy-axis sum(|r|) should be bounded. No single pair should surge >2x when another pair improves. Track per-axis total |r|.
- E2: rawRollingAbsCorr should be significantly higher than rollingAbsCorr for pairs active during coherent regime. Targets should tighten during/after coherent.
- E3: coherent should not exceed 65%. maxConsecutiveCoherent < 200. evolving > 8%.
- E4: density-entropy avg < 0.30 despite density product in 0.72–0.78 range.
- E5: cadenceAlignment maintains avg > 0.18 regardless of profile. No module below 0.12.
- E6: flicker avg > 0.95, product > 0.88. density-flicker coupling should not surge.
- Aggregate: These 6 evolutions form a complete self-healing layer. If all work, future rounds should require NO manual constant tuning — only algorithmic improvements.

## R17 — 2026-03-03 — STABLE

**Profile:** explosive | **Beats:** 414 | **Duration:** 59.8s | **Notes:** 15,640
**Fingerprint:** 9/9 stable | Drifted: none | Cross-profile: atmospheric→explosive (1.3x widening)

### Key Observations
- Self-calibrating regime saturation (structural fix #2) **CONFIRMED**: coherent dropped 80.4%→51.4% (-29pts), evolving recovered 1.9%→16.2% (+14pts). maxConsecutiveCoherent 506→213. No profile-specific tuning needed.
- Universal |r|>0.85 escalation **CONFIRMED**: entropy-trust r crushed 0.880→0.487.
- Flicker **recovered** above 1.0: avg 0.950→1.002. Graduated density-flicker escalation reduced over-crushing.
- Universal trust floor **PARTIALLY REGRESSED**: coefficient 0.30 produces floor ~0.103, LOWER than old per-module 0.20 floors. cadenceAlignment avg crashed 0.226→0.110 (-51%).
- Coupling health **degraded**: 4 hotspots (was 2). density-flicker surged avg 0.430→0.580 (+35%), r=-0.951 (worst ever). tension-entropy resurgence r=-0.048→-0.815. Root cause: adaptive target relaxation drift (baseline 0.12 can relax to 0.55) compounded by cross-section memory preservation.
- Tension arc tail collapsed: Q90 0.460→0.297 as exploring regime (beats 310–414) drives low tension. Direct consequence of regime rebalancing.
- Beat-setup budget: 0/414 exceeded (perfect).
- 7 correlation direction flips (cross-profile expected).

### Evolutions Applied (from R12–R16 consolidated + R17 structural)
- Structural Fix 1: Cross-section coupling memory — **inconclusive** — targets preserved but hotspots increased 2→4; adaptive target relaxation drift may be counteracting the benefit
- Structural Fix 2: Self-calibrating regime saturation — **confirmed** — coherent 80.4%→51.4%, evolving 1.9%→16.2%, no manual tuning
- Structural Fix 3: Universal population-derived trust floor — **partially refuted** — coefficient 0.30 too aggressive; cadenceAlignment crashed; restSynchronizer marginal +4%; entropyRegulator freed (+38%)
- R17 E1: Coherent penalty cap 0.10→0.18 — **superseded** by structural fix #2 (self-calibrating)
- R17 E2: density-trust target 0.15 — **inconclusive** — r=0.922 (was 0.949), mild improvement, still highly correlated
- R17 E3: Universal |r|>0.85 escalation — **confirmed** — entropy-trust r crushed 0.880→0.487
- R17 E4: restSynchronizer trust floor 0.20 — **superseded** by structural fix #3 (universal floor)
- R17 E5: Graduated density-flicker escalation — **partially confirmed** — flicker recovered above 1.0, but density-flicker avg surged 35% suggesting threshold too permissive or target drifted
- R17 E6: Regime depth tracking — **confirmed** — maxConsecutiveCoherent=213, transitionCount=3 visible in trace-summary

### Evolutions Proposed (for R18)
- E1: Raise universal trust floor coefficient 0.30→0.50 — adaptiveTrustScores.js
- E2: Bound adaptive target relaxation to baseline*2.5 — pipelineCouplingManager.js
- E3: Remove tension-entropy from universal |r|>0.85 exclusion — pipelineCouplingManager.js
- E4: Graduated cross-section target dampening by pair drift — pipelineCouplingManager.js
- E5: Track adaptive target drift in trace-summary — pipelineCouplingManager.js, trace-summary.js
- E6: Warm-start section gains for chronically elevated pairs — pipelineCouplingManager.js

### Hypotheses to Track
- With trust floor coefficient at 0.50, cadenceAlignment should recover to avg > 0.15 without per-module hardcoding.
- Bounded target relaxation (baseline*2.5) should prevent density-flicker adaptive target from exceeding 0.30, reducing avg coupling below 0.50.
- Allowing tension-entropy into universal |r|>0.85 should reduce its avg below 0.35.
- Adaptive target tracking will reveal whether coupling surges are target-drift-driven or profile-inherent.
- Self-calibrating regime saturation should continue to hold coherent < 65% regardless of profile.

## R12–R17 Consolidated — 2026-03-03 — ALL STABLE

**Rounds:** R12 through R16 | **Verdict:** STABLE every round
**Profiles:** explosive (R12–R15), atmospheric (R16)
**Range:** 496–696 beats, 79–101s, 18765–26863 notes

### The Arc: What Happened

Across 5 completed rounds of generational evolution, the fingerprint verdict was STABLE every time (0 drifted dimensions). Each round followed the same pattern: identify a metric outlier, manually tune a constant (threshold, target, cap, floor), run, see the fix work but a new outlier emerge, repeat. The system was globally stable but locally fragile — every fix introduced a new constant that itself needed tuning next round.

**Key achievements (R12–R16):**
- Cross-profile fingerprint comparison (1.3x tolerance widening) — eliminated false DRIFTED verdicts
- Coupling hotspots reduced from 6 to 2 via persistent hotspot gain, pair-specific targets, and escalation pathways
- Tension-entropy coupling crushed from r=-0.723/avg 0.584 to r=-0.048/avg 0.295
- density-entropy coupling crushed from avg 0.338 to 0.163 (pair target 0.12)
- cadenceAlignment trust stabilized at 0.20+ via hard floor; feedbackOscillator recovered via velocity support
- Regime distribution swung from 58% exploring (R13) to 73% coherent (R14) to 55% coherent (R15) to 80% coherent (R16)
- Tension tail sustain floor lifted 90th-percentile from 0.402 to 0.460
- Trace diagnostics: beat-setup spike stage breakdown, regime depth tracking, 9-dimension fingerprint

**Persistent failures:**
- restSynchronizer trust stuck at avg ~0.199 for 4 generations despite warm-start and auto-nourishment
- Evolving regime declined for 3 consecutive generations (6.5% → 4.8% → 1.9%)
- Each round surfaced a new coupling hotspot (whack-a-mole: tension-entropy, density-entropy, density-trust, entropy-trust)
- Coherent regime saturation penalty required cap adjustment every round (0.10 → 0.18)

### Meta-Analysis: Why Self-Healing Wasn't Healing

The system has 11 hypermeta controllers designed to auto-tune coupling targets, trust recovery, regime balance, gain budgets, and more. Despite this, every round was still manual constant-tuning. Three root causes:

1. **Section-scoped resets destroy learned state.** The self-calibrating coupling targets (#1 hypermeta) reset to baselines every section boundary. With 4–5 sections per composition, the adaptive EMA (~50-beat warmup) barely converges before being wiped. We kept manually pre-seeding PAIR_TARGETS because the adaptive system never got enough runway.

2. **Regime saturation has no meta-controller.** The coherent entry threshold, penalty onset, rate, and cap are all static constants. Profile changes (explosive → atmospheric) invalidate them immediately. The only self-healing for exploring→coherent transitions exists; NO analogous mechanism exists for exiting coherent. This was the single biggest gap.

3. **Trust floors were per-module constants, not population-derived.** We added hard floors for cadenceAlignment (R14), then restSynchronizer (R17), each requiring a manual evolution. The auto-nourishment system (hypermeta #5) required 100+ stagnant beats to trigger — too slow for section-scoped lifetimes.

### Structural Fix: R17

Instead of 6 more constant tweaks, R17 implements three structural changes to break the manual-tuning cycle:

1. **Cross-section coupling memory** — `_adaptiveTargets` preserved across section resets (only gains reset). Lets hypermeta #1 accumulate structural knowledge across the full composition.
2. **Self-calibrating regime saturation** — penalty derived from rolling coherent-share EMA. When coherent share > 60%, penalty scales automatically. Eliminates static cap/rate/onset constants.
3. **Universal population-derived trust floor** — `floor = max(0.05, meanTrust * 0.30)`. Replaces per-module hard-coded floors. Adapts to whatever the current trust ecosystem looks like.

### Hypotheses to Track
- With coupling targets preserved across sections, PAIR_TARGETS manual tuning should become unnecessary within 2–3 rounds.
- Self-calibrating regime saturation should keep coherent < 70% regardless of profile without further constant changes.
- Universal trust floor should lift restSynchronizer above 0.25 avg without any module-specific code.
- The whack-a-mole coupling hotspot pattern should break: universal |r| > 0.85 escalation plus longer target memory should preempt emergent couplings.
