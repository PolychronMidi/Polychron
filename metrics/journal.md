## R18 — 2026-03-03 — STABLE

**Profile:** atmospheric | **Beats:** 522 | **Duration:** 66.8s | **Notes:** 19,129
**Fingerprint:** 9/9 stable | Drifted: none | Cross-profile: explosive→atmospheric (1.3x widening)

### Key Observations
- **E1 CONFIRMED:** cadenceAlignment trust recovered 0.110→0.214 (+95%). Universal trust floor coefficient 0.50 produces floor ~0.171, properly lifting starved modules. restSynchronizer also improved 0.206→0.218.
- **E3 CONFIRMED:** tension-entropy avg crushed 0.407→0.247 (-39%), r -0.815→-0.485. Universal |r|>0.85 escalation stacking with pair-specific 1.2x = total 1.38x working. Gain 0.572, heat 0.51 — actively fighting.
- **E2 CONFIRMED:** density-flicker target bounded at baseline*2.5=0.30, current=0.1155 (below baseline). Target never approached cap. avg improved 0.580→0.479 (-17%).
- **E5 CONFIRMED (diagnostic):** Adaptive target snapshot reveals critical insight: end-of-run rolling |r| (0.148–0.308) far below full-run coupling averages (0.247–0.480). Proves coupling surges are **regime-modulated, not target-drift-driven**. Coherent relaxation masks structural coupling from adaptive targets.
- **WHACK-A-MOLE EMPIRICALLY PROVEN:** Fixing tension-entropy redistributed correlation energy to density-entropy (avg 0.135→0.432, +3.2x) and flicker-entropy (avg 0.194→0.480, +2.5x). Root cause: per-pair decorrelation treats pairs independently but they share axes (entropy shared by 5 pairs). Total entropy-axis |r| approximately conserved.
- **Regime saturation REGRESSED:** coherent 51.4%→72.8% (+21pts). maxConsecutiveCoherent 213→326. evolving crashed 16.2%→2.3%. Self-calibrating penalty works but _COHERENT_SHARE_ALPHA=0.01 (~100-beat horizon) converges too slowly for atmospheric profile.
- **Density product guard BLOCKING tightening:** density product 0.7357 < 0.75 binary guard blocked ALL density pair tightening for most of the run, preventing density-entropy target from recovering toward baseline even when resolved.
- **Flicker REGRESSION:** avg 0.921 (was 1.002), product 0.9033. pipelineCouplingManager flicker bias 0.8826 — chronic over-compression via multi-pair flicker decorrelation.
- **NEW flicker-trust concern:** r 0.763→0.886, now above universal |r|>0.85 threshold. Will trigger escalation next run.
- Tension arc RECOVERED: [0.370, 0.610, 0.512, 0.488] — best shape in review history. 5 sections sustain tension.
- Pipeline 16/16 passed, 10/10 tuning invariants, 1/522 beat-setup spike.

### Evolutions Applied (from R17)
- E1: Trust floor coefficient 0.30→0.50 — **confirmed** — cadenceAlignment +95% (0.110→0.214), restSynchronizer +6%
- E2: Bound adaptive target relaxation to baseline*2.5 — **confirmed** — density-flicker target stayed below 0.1155, never approached 0.30 cap
- E3: Remove tension-entropy universal escalation exclusion — **confirmed** — tension-entropy r crushed -0.815→-0.485, avg 0.407→0.247
- E4: Graduated cross-section dampening by pair drift — **inconclusive** — only 5 section transitions, insufficient data to isolate graduated vs uniform dampening
- E5: Adaptive target tracking in trace-summary — **confirmed** — first-ever diagnostic reveals regime-modulated coupling masking. Critical for E2 dual-EMA proposal.
- E6: Warm-start section gains for elevated pairs — **partially confirmed** — density-flicker improved 0.580→0.479, but warm-start insufficient for new entropy-axis hotspots that emerged mid-run

### Evolutions Proposed (for R19)
- E1: Axis-centric coupling energy conservation — pipelineCouplingManager.js
- E2: Regime-transparent target adaptation (dual-EMA) — pipelineCouplingManager.js
- E3: Profile-adaptive regime saturation convergence — regimeClassifier.js
- E4: Density product guard sigmoid — pipelineCouplingManager.js
- E5: Self-deriving trust floor coefficient — adaptiveTrustScores.js
- E6: Flicker product floor constraint — pipelineCouplingManager.js

### Hypotheses to Track
- E1: Entropy-axis sum(|r|) should be bounded. No single pair should surge >2x when another pair improves. Track per-axis total |r|.
- E2: rawRollingAbsCorr should be significantly higher than rollingAbsCorr for pairs active during coherent regime. Targets should tighten during/after coherent.
- E3: coherent should not exceed 65%. maxConsecutiveCoherent < 200. evolving > 8%.
- E4: density-entropy avg < 0.30 despite density product in 0.72–0.78 range.
- E5: cadenceAlignment maintains avg > 0.18 regardless of profile. No module below 0.12.
- E6: flicker avg > 0.95, product > 0.88. density-flicker coupling should not surge.
- Aggregate: These 6 evolutions form a complete self-healing layer. If all work, future rounds should require NO manual constant tuning — only algorithmic improvements.

## R17 — 2026-03-03 — STABLE

**Profile:** explosive | **Beats:** 414 | **Duration:** 59.8s | **Notes:** 15,640
**Fingerprint:** 9/9 stable | Drifted: none | Cross-profile: atmospheric→explosive (1.3x widening)

### Key Observations
- Self-calibrating regime saturation (structural fix #2) **CONFIRMED**: coherent dropped 80.4%→51.4% (-29pts), evolving recovered 1.9%→16.2% (+14pts). maxConsecutiveCoherent 506→213. No profile-specific tuning needed.
- Universal |r|>0.85 escalation **CONFIRMED**: entropy-trust r crushed 0.880→0.487.
- Flicker **recovered** above 1.0: avg 0.950→1.002. Graduated density-flicker escalation reduced over-crushing.
- Universal trust floor **PARTIALLY REGRESSED**: coefficient 0.30 produces floor ~0.103, LOWER than old per-module 0.20 floors. cadenceAlignment avg crashed 0.226→0.110 (-51%).
- Coupling health **degraded**: 4 hotspots (was 2). density-flicker surged avg 0.430→0.580 (+35%), r=-0.951 (worst ever). tension-entropy resurgence r=-0.048→-0.815. Root cause: adaptive target relaxation drift (baseline 0.12 can relax to 0.55) compounded by cross-section memory preservation.
- Tension arc tail collapsed: Q90 0.460→0.297 as exploring regime (beats 310–414) drives low tension. Direct consequence of regime rebalancing.
- Beat-setup budget: 0/414 exceeded (perfect).
- 7 correlation direction flips (cross-profile expected).

### Evolutions Applied (from R12–R16 consolidated + R17 structural)
- Structural Fix 1: Cross-section coupling memory — **inconclusive** — targets preserved but hotspots increased 2→4; adaptive target relaxation drift may be counteracting the benefit
- Structural Fix 2: Self-calibrating regime saturation — **confirmed** — coherent 80.4%→51.4%, evolving 1.9%→16.2%, no manual tuning
- Structural Fix 3: Universal population-derived trust floor — **partially refuted** — coefficient 0.30 too aggressive; cadenceAlignment crashed; restSynchronizer marginal +4%; entropyRegulator freed (+38%)
- R17 E1: Coherent penalty cap 0.10→0.18 — **superseded** by structural fix #2 (self-calibrating)
- R17 E2: density-trust target 0.15 — **inconclusive** — r=0.922 (was 0.949), mild improvement, still highly correlated
- R17 E3: Universal |r|>0.85 escalation — **confirmed** — entropy-trust r crushed 0.880→0.487
- R17 E4: restSynchronizer trust floor 0.20 — **superseded** by structural fix #3 (universal floor)
- R17 E5: Graduated density-flicker escalation — **partially confirmed** — flicker recovered above 1.0, but density-flicker avg surged 35% suggesting threshold too permissive or target drifted
- R17 E6: Regime depth tracking — **confirmed** — maxConsecutiveCoherent=213, transitionCount=3 visible in trace-summary

### Evolutions Proposed (for R18)
- E1: Raise universal trust floor coefficient 0.30→0.50 — adaptiveTrustScores.js
- E2: Bound adaptive target relaxation to baseline*2.5 — pipelineCouplingManager.js
- E3: Remove tension-entropy from universal |r|>0.85 exclusion — pipelineCouplingManager.js
- E4: Graduated cross-section target dampening by pair drift — pipelineCouplingManager.js
- E5: Track adaptive target drift in trace-summary — pipelineCouplingManager.js, trace-summary.js
- E6: Warm-start section gains for chronically elevated pairs — pipelineCouplingManager.js

### Hypotheses to Track
- With trust floor coefficient at 0.50, cadenceAlignment should recover to avg > 0.15 without per-module hardcoding.
- Bounded target relaxation (baseline*2.5) should prevent density-flicker adaptive target from exceeding 0.30, reducing avg coupling below 0.50.
- Allowing tension-entropy into universal |r|>0.85 should reduce its avg below 0.35.
- Adaptive target tracking will reveal whether coupling surges are target-drift-driven or profile-inherent.
- Self-calibrating regime saturation should continue to hold coherent < 65% regardless of profile.

## R12–R17 Consolidated — 2026-03-03 — ALL STABLE

**Rounds:** R12 through R16 | **Verdict:** STABLE every round
**Profiles:** explosive (R12–R15), atmospheric (R16)
**Range:** 496–696 beats, 79–101s, 18765–26863 notes

### The Arc: What Happened

Across 5 completed rounds of generational evolution, the fingerprint verdict was STABLE every time (0 drifted dimensions). Each round followed the same pattern: identify a metric outlier, manually tune a constant (threshold, target, cap, floor), run, see the fix work but a new outlier emerge, repeat. The system was globally stable but locally fragile — every fix introduced a new constant that itself needed tuning next round.

**Key achievements (R12–R16):**
- Cross-profile fingerprint comparison (1.3x tolerance widening) — eliminated false DRIFTED verdicts
- Coupling hotspots reduced from 6 to 2 via persistent hotspot gain, pair-specific targets, and escalation pathways
- Tension-entropy coupling crushed from r=-0.723/avg 0.584 to r=-0.048/avg 0.295
- density-entropy coupling crushed from avg 0.338 to 0.163 (pair target 0.12)
- cadenceAlignment trust stabilized at 0.20+ via hard floor; feedbackOscillator recovered via velocity support
- Regime distribution swung from 58% exploring (R13) to 73% coherent (R14) to 55% coherent (R15) to 80% coherent (R16)
- Tension tail sustain floor lifted 90th-percentile from 0.402 to 0.460
- Trace diagnostics: beat-setup spike stage breakdown, regime depth tracking, 9-dimension fingerprint

**Persistent failures:**
- restSynchronizer trust stuck at avg ~0.199 for 4 generations despite warm-start and auto-nourishment
- Evolving regime declined for 3 consecutive generations (6.5% → 4.8% → 1.9%)
- Each round surfaced a new coupling hotspot (whack-a-mole: tension-entropy, density-entropy, density-trust, entropy-trust)
- Coherent regime saturation penalty required cap adjustment every round (0.10 → 0.18)

### Meta-Analysis: Why Self-Healing Wasn't Healing

The system has 11 hypermeta controllers designed to auto-tune coupling targets, trust recovery, regime balance, gain budgets, and more. Despite this, every round was still manual constant-tuning. Three root causes:

1. **Section-scoped resets destroy learned state.** The self-calibrating coupling targets (#1 hypermeta) reset to baselines every section boundary. With 4–5 sections per composition, the adaptive EMA (~50-beat warmup) barely converges before being wiped. We kept manually pre-seeding PAIR_TARGETS because the adaptive system never got enough runway.

2. **Regime saturation has no meta-controller.** The coherent entry threshold, penalty onset, rate, and cap are all static constants. Profile changes (explosive → atmospheric) invalidate them immediately. The only self-healing for exploring→coherent transitions exists; NO analogous mechanism exists for exiting coherent. This was the single biggest gap.

3. **Trust floors were per-module constants, not population-derived.** We added hard floors for cadenceAlignment (R14), then restSynchronizer (R17), each requiring a manual evolution. The auto-nourishment system (hypermeta #5) required 100+ stagnant beats to trigger — too slow for section-scoped lifetimes.

### Structural Fix: R17

Instead of 6 more constant tweaks, R17 implements three structural changes to break the manual-tuning cycle:

1. **Cross-section coupling memory** — `_adaptiveTargets` preserved across section resets (only gains reset). Lets hypermeta #1 accumulate structural knowledge across the full composition.
2. **Self-calibrating regime saturation** — penalty derived from rolling coherent-share EMA. When coherent share > 60%, penalty scales automatically. Eliminates static cap/rate/onset constants.
3. **Universal population-derived trust floor** — `floor = max(0.05, meanTrust * 0.30)`. Replaces per-module hard-coded floors. Adapts to whatever the current trust ecosystem looks like.

### Hypotheses to Track
- With coupling targets preserved across sections, PAIR_TARGETS manual tuning should become unnecessary within 2–3 rounds.
- Self-calibrating regime saturation should keep coherent < 70% regardless of profile without further constant changes.
- Universal trust floor should lift restSynchronizer above 0.25 avg without any module-specific code.
- The whack-a-mole coupling hotspot pattern should break: universal |r| > 0.85 escalation plus longer target memory should preempt emergent couplings.
